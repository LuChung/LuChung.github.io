                            <h5>OVERVIEW</h5>
                            <p>The goal of this AI Mock Interview app offers job interview training for job seekers, which guides users to build confidence around their talent. With this tool, users can practice how to structure better answers to a representative before real in-person interviews but rethink their interview skills from the advice from an AI tutor.</p>
                            <p>I came with the idea of how a digital tool can be very "warm-heart" and helps people who have self-motivation to build their skills. By collecting users' feedback, the app can customize the training courses based on their needs. The project is also inspired by an AI Friends app, <a href="https://replika.ai/" class="cool-link" target="_blank">Replika</a>, which allows people to track their mental health through the interaction with a chatbot conversation.</p>


                            <h5>OBJECTIVE</h5>

                     <h4>Design Question</h4>

                     <p>I provided the Five Ws questions(Who, What, When, Where, Why) as below to gather information and problems that I intend to solve in this project. For example: with "Who" questions, I listed the potential users who might be involved in the app. The Five Ws questions also help me to develop my thoughts into the next step, research questions.</p>

                        <h4>Research Questions</h4>
                        <p>I intended to find out the following questions. How might we create a safe place to develop interview skills? Or how might we help people new to the job market feel less stressed about interviews? How might we coach job seekers to present their best selves? Thus, I separated the research questions and scope into three key steps:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Set up object: </strong>What effect does daily use of AI chatbots have on the emotional feelings of users?</li>
                            <li><strong>Refine learning process: </strong>What are the most effective communication strategies to boost competitiveness for job interviews?</li>
                            <li><strong>Impact result: </strong>How can users develop their confidence to shape who they are after using AI Mock Interview?</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>EMOTION RESEARCH</h3>

                    <h4>Objective</h4>
                        <p>Based on my research questions, I decided to talk with people who are going through interviews and also people who are interacting with chatbots in more extended ways.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Understand target users’ emotional reactions: before interviews, during interviews, after interviews.</li>
                        <li>Learn from users’ emotional feelings when they use chatbots tools.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Methodology</h4>
                    <p>I conducted two different approaches to collect research subjects' points of view. I applied qualitative analysis on job seekers and used quantitative analysis to survey people who have talked to chatbots.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Qualitative analysis: </strong>interviews with six participants about and measure their emotional feelings with YouX Emotions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Quantitative analysis: </strong>conduct the questionnaire with nine participants who have experience interacting with chatbots.</li>
                    </ul>
                <br>
                    <h4>Interview Plan</h4>
                        <p>To understand the experiences of job seekers, I decided to the effective method for qualitative research. The interview helps me explain and explore users' opinions and behaviors. I asked seven open-ended questions to collect in-depth information. Here are my interview questions:</p>
                    

                            <img src="img/blog-img/aimock-ip.png" alt="" class="img-responsive">
                    <br>
                    <h4>Questionnaire Plan</h4>
                        <p>In the questionnaire section, I decided to use open-ended questions to bring up the possible data. A major reason for this is how users can pick up terms flexibly to express their emotional feelings. The participant can also describe their experiences with chatbots without restricted answers. In that case, the results rather than be coded by computers. The outcomes of the survey are classified according to users' issues through manual categorization. Here are my questionnaire questions:</p>

                    <h3>Findings & Recommendations</h3>
                    <h4>Interview on job interviews</h4>
                    <p>The typical stereotypes regarding emotion do exist in this interview.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Gender stereotype: </strong>three male participants had delighted, excited feeling and feel confident about job interview experiences. A female said her nervous feelings decline after gaining more experiences. Two female participants had negative emotions. The feelings came from how the interview representative treated them.</li>
                        <li><strong>Age stereotype: </strong>young professionals whose age under 25 mentioned that their interview experiences of internships. Overall, they had a positive reaction and felt strong-delighted, excited, and interested.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cultural stereotype: </strong>there is one participant who worked in the transportation industry and expressed extremely angry, disappointed, and frustrated about her experiences.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Questionnaire on chatbots</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Finding 1: </strong>chatbots are harder to recognize keywords and identify users' questions.</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Recommendation: allowed users some flexibility in choosing the types of questions or guide the user through the linear flow.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li><strong>Finding 2: </strong>two participants pointed out that chatbots are less anthropomorphized.</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Recommendation: refer to the four primary tone-of-voice dimensions to design chatbots with consistent tone throughout the conversation.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li><strong>Finding 3: </strong>two participants mentioned about time-consuming communication.</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Recommendation: provide predetermined links and buttons to save users from typing.</li>
                            </ul>
                    </ul>

                    <br>
                    <p>According to the finding of the interview on job interviews, I designed the figure below: to present participants' emotional changes before interviews, during interviews, and after interviews through three various colors. I created six avatars to represent each participant and show their emotions on the scale of YouX emotion.</p>

                    <h4>Raw Data</h4>
                    <p>After the interviews and Questionnaires, I took notes of participants' video records. Please check the following link to see the research details of the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1f-AEPH8eMlv8Gu-jtKKez--8YrECOp3u?usp=sharinghttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JzrtTwSCGNl3a7asJTKZlTkwg-QeWK7u?usp=sharing" class="cool-link" target="_blank">raw data</a>.</p>

                    <h4>Research Conclusion</h4>
                    <p>Due to interview experiences vary from individuals. How to make users have customized mock interviews might be a crucial challenge in this project. Besides, the design needs to follow the UX principles of chatbots. The conversation should guide users through simple linear flows with a limited number of branches that depend on acceptable user answers.</p>

                    <h4>Physical Model</h4>
                    <p>I also created a physical model of insights from my research. The figure presents the data of YouX Emotions. The inspiration refers to the <a href="http://dataphys.org/list/gallery/" class="cool-link" target="_blank">data physicalization</a> from Wikipedia. The discussions interpret how to read and understand the information and the cultural meaning behind the image.</p>

                <h4>Evaluation</h4>
                <p>I evaluated my project with Eli from Coffee Tech Talks. He gave me feedback regarding my Emotion Research. Also, I did the peer reviews with Yi. He provided suggestions regarding customizing the users’ experiences and future insight.</p>

                    <div class="dot3"></div>
                </div>

                <h4>Future Direction</h4>
                <p>What will/could be the next steps in the project:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Visualize the data collected from users.</li>
                    <li>Reminder and feedback features.</li>
                    <li>Usability testing and iterate the design.</li>
                    <li>Create site maps, user flow charts, and lo-fi prototypes.</li>
                </ul>

                <br>

                <h4>Reflections</h4>
                <p>During this project, I felt it's very challenging to make one user interface but provide a "different" experience from other users. I have to take a human as one part of the collected data and see individual users as a "person." Take the interview of emotion research as an example. People who work in different work environments could face a contrary situation during a job interview. Introvert and extrovert personalities might need an opposite way to learn and build their confidence. To address those problems, I design the solution that users can select their character and choose the intensity of the level on the courses. </p>
